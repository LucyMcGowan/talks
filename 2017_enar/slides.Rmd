--

- a review of **90 observational studies** with statistically significant findings published in 2015 in

  - JAMA
  - NEJM
  - AJE

--

- 41 (45.6%) **mentioned the issue** of unmeasured confounding as a limitation  

--

- 4 (4.4%) **included a quantitative sensitivity analysis**

# Tipping point analysis

- interested in which values of an unmeasured confounder would cause the lower or upper confidence interval of the association measure to cross 1

--

- assuming the senstivity parameters are fixed, we can extend these methods to confidence bounds

---

class: middle
## "in order for our association to no longer be significant, there would need to exist an unmeasured confounder of size $\Gamma$ that is prevalent in $p_1$ of the exposed population and $p_0$ of the unexposed population."
---
class: center, middle

# $\Gamma(LB, p_0, p_1) = \frac{(1-p_1)+LB(p_0-1)}{LBp_0-p_1}$
---

# Write-up

These methods can easily be incorporated in any study using the following formula:
--

1. State the primary analysis result

--

2. State the size and prevalence of a hypothetical "tipping point" confounder

--

3. Anchor this in an example from your study
---

<!-- # Example -->

<!-- - retrospective cohort using national Veterans Health Administration (VHA) databases  -->

<!-- -- -->

<!-- - comparing heart failure among patients initiating two diabetes drugs, metformin or sulfonylurea. -->

<!-- -- -->

<!-- - each patient initiated on metformin was propensity score-matched to a patient initiated on sulfonylurea -->
<!-- --- -->
# State the primary analysis results

### The primary analysis yielded a greater risk of heart failure with sulfonylurea use over metformin use; HR (95% CI): 1.40 (1.30, 1.50). 

---
# State a size and prevalence of a hypothetical “tipping point” confounder:

### A hypothetical unobserved binary confounder with a 10% prevalence difference ($p_0=0$, $p_1=0.1$) between the therapies would need to have an association with heart failure of HR=4.0 to tip this analysis to nonsignificance at a 5% level.

---
# Anchor this in an example from your study:

### For a comparison from the observed confounders, baseline heart failure history had a prevalence difference of 5% in the pre-matching cohort and an association with CHF of HR=2.30; which would have been insufficient to tip this analysis had we not adjusted for it.

# Conclusion

- we have presented a useful, **easily implemented**, and  intuitively understood approach to allow researchers to assess the potential impact of unmeasured  confounders in observational research

--

- our universal figures can be applied to both past and future research, allowing readers to understand the sensitivity of studies that do not include such an analysis, and allowing future investigators to readily include such an analysis.

*On the other hand, it took us embarrassingly long to clue in to the lung cancer/cigarette thing, so I guess the real lesson is "figuring out which ideas are true is hard."*

# Lin, Pstay, and Kronmal

- algebraically derive in log-linear regression

  - assuming the unmeasured confounder is independent of covariates conditional on the exposure

--

- provide simulations that show  these sensitivity analyses can be extended to the **logistic regression** and **censored survival time** cases

--

  - assuming the event is rare or if $|\gamma|$ is small, this approximation holds for logistic regression

--

  - assuming the event is rare or the effect of U on T is small, which implies that $\Lambda_0(t)$ or $|\gamma|$ is small, this approximation holds for survial analysis

---
# log-linear algebra from Lin et al

- what we fit:

$P(Y=1|X,\mathbf{Z}) = \exp(\alpha^{*}+\beta^{*}X+\boldsymbol\theta^{*'}\mathbf{Z})$

--

- what we wish we fit:

$P(Y = 1|X, \mathbf{Z})=\exp(\alpha+\beta X+\boldsymbol{\theta}'\mathbf{Z})\{\exp(\gamma X)P_{X,\mathbf{Z}}+(1-P_{X,\mathbf{Z}})\}$

--

- assume that $U$ is independent of $\mathbf{Z}$ conditional on $X$, therefore $P_{X,\mathbf{Z}}=P_{X}$

--

$P(Y = 1|X,\mathbf{Z})=$
$\hspace{1cm}\exp\Big[\alpha +\log\{e^{\gamma_0}p_0+(1-p_0)\}+\Big\{\beta+\log\frac{e^{\gamma_1}p_1+(1-p_1)}{e^{\gamma_0}p_0+(1-p_0)}\Big\}X+\boldsymbol\theta'\mathbf{Z}\Big]$

--
* setting what we fit = what we wish we fit

$\beta = \beta^*-\log\frac{e^{\gamma_1}p_1+(1-p_1)}{e^{\gamma_0}p_0+(1-p_0)}$
